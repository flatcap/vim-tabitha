INTRODUCTION                                            *tabitha*

Tabitha helps you switch between windows and tabs.

The plugin creates mappings to help you quickly navigate between windows and tabs.
Pressing &lt;Tab&gt; in normal mode will move the focus to the next window.
If there are no more windows, the next tab will be selected.

By pressing &lt;S-Tab&gt; the focus will be moved to the previous window, or tab.

CONFIGURATION                                         *tabitha-config*

The behaviour of Tabitha is controlled by four global variables:

  let g:tabitha_navigate_windows = 1
  let g:tabitha_navigate_tabs    = 1
  let g:tabitha_wrap_around      = 1
  let g:tabitha_select_window    = 1

MAPPINGS                                              *tabitha-mappings*

By default, Tabitha will create two mappings:

  <Tab>   Move forwards through windows
  <S-Tab> Move backwards through windows

These can be disabled by setting:

  let g:tabitha_create_mappings = 0

You can create your own mappings which call Tabitha, e.g.

  nnoremap <silent> <F3> :call tabitha#Switch (1)<CR>
  nnoremap <silent> <F4> :call tabitha#Switch (0)<CR>

See the 'API' Section, below, for more details.

API                                                   *tabitha-api*

Tabitha introduces three functions to vim.
They are configured by four variables, described in 'Configuation', above.

  function tabitha#NextWindow (...)
  function tabitha#NextTab (...)
  function tabitha#Switch (...)

NEXTWINDOW                                            *tabitha-next-window*

NextWindow moves the cursor to the next/previous window.
It takes two optional parameters which both default to 1 (true)

  tabitha#NextWindow (forwards, wrap)

  forwards -- direction of change
  wrap     -- wrap around at end of window list

e.g.

  call tabitha#NextWindow (1, 1)

NEXTTAB                                               *tabitha-next-tab*

NextTab moves the cursor to the next/previous tab.
It takes three optional parameters which all default to 1 (true)

  tabitha#NextTab (forwards, wrap, select_window)

  forwards      -- direction of change
  wrap          -- wrap around at end of tab list
  select_window -- when switching tabs, pick the first/last window

e.g.

  call tabitha#NextTab (1, 0, 1)

SWITCH                                                *tabitha-switch*

Switch moves the cursor to the next/previous window/tab
(dependent on configuration).
It takes one optional parameter which defaults to 1 (true)

  tabitha#Switch (forwards)

  forwards -- direction of change (0 for backwards)

e.g.

  call tabitha#Switch (1)

NAMING                                                *tabitha-naming*

The plugin is whimsically named after the default key mapping.
The name 'Tabitha' is derived from an Aramaic word meaning gazelle.
